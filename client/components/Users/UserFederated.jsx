              When using federated connections like AD, ADFS, SAML.. you&#39;ll only know the
              user once they have logged in for the first time. This tab will allow you to define
              group and role memberships for users that have not logged in yet (by specifying what
              the user identifier will look like upon first login). When the user logs in for the
              first time, they will receive the groups and roles configured here and the pending
              user will become an actual user.
