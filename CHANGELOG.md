**BREAKING CHANGE:** After upgrading to 2.6 or a higher version, you need to do the following to continue operation:

1. Rotate your key and re-publish the rule on the extension's Configuration page. This is needed due to the changed
   logic on storing and handling the Api Key.
2. The rule published by this extension is named `auth0-authorization-extension`. Check your tenant's rules. If you see
   a rule named `auth0-authz` disable/remove it **by following the instructions below**.

#### Checklist to disable/remove `auth0-authz` rule:

1.  Go to your tenant's rules
2.  Modify `auth0-authorization-extension`'s order to be right next to `auth0-authz` extension.
3.  Check `auth0-authz` to be sure that it is not authored by you and no manual changes are done.
4.  Check `auth0-authz` to be sure that disabling/removing it will not change authorization flow in a way to grant
    access or privileges to users that shouldn't have it.
5.  Disable the `auth0-authz` rule. After verifying that everything is in order, you can choose to keep
    it disabled or remove it.

Failing to do these will cause an "InvalidApiKey" or "You are not allowed to access this application." error on rule
execution.

- Added possibility to rotate ApiKey.
- Now saving ApiKey to rules-configs instead of adding it into the rule.
- API: add groups/roles to user by id or name
